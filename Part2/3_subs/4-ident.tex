The model parameters and their variances are estimated using a combination of static experimental data and dynamic responses obtained under small-perturbation conditions. Subsequently, the resulting model is validated against the dynamic response of the full nonlinear model.

\subsection{Aerodynamic coefficients and friction}
Aerodynamic coefficients and friction parameters are accurately estimated
through a least-squares estimation approach, as depicted in Fig.-\ref{fig::CT}
and Fig.-\ref{fig::CD}. The experimental setup, shown in
Fig.-\ref{fig::expt_setup}, records the total moment at the base, which
encompasses both aerodynamic moments and BLDC motor friction. It's worth noting
that the moment data exhibits greater variability than the model due to
unmodeled aerodynamic effects, such as aerodynamic flutter.
