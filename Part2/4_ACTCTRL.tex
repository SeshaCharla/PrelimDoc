\chapter{DCARC Control of the Actuator}
%===
Adaptive robust control (ARC) combines the asymptotic performance from parameter adaptation of adaptive control (MRAC)
with the transient performance of the nonlinear robust control techniques such as sliding mode
control(\cite{yao1997adaptive}, \cite{yao2010advanced}). This is primarily achieved by decoupling the stability of the
system from the adaptation law using projection to limit the domain of adaptation. Then a robust control law is
independently designed to ensure the transient performance across the entire domain of parameter values.

The projection operator also gives an added advantage of using non-gradient type adaptation laws like recursive least
squares (RLS) resulting in a faster parameter convergence (\cite{yao2003integrated}). Similarly, we can reduce the
effect of sensor noise on the adaptation and model compensation by designing the regression vectors for the parameter
estimation and model compensation solely based on the reference instead of the state measurements
(\cite{yao1998desired}, \cite{lu2008desired},\cite{hong2007globally}). This is particularly useful in the present
scenario where the RPM measurements are prone to significant noise. The stability is ensured by having additional
conditions on the stabilizing feedback. Such a design can also be used in the presence of actuator saturation.

The current study adopts the design and method of proof proposed in \cite{yao1998desired} for a first order nonlinear
system with friction and disturbance. The input saturation is implicitly considered in the reference system design,
filtering out the high-frequency components of the reference signal that can cause the actuator saturation due to model
compensation input. Additionally, the effects of saturation due to robust and stabilizing feedback can be explicitly
considered as in \cite{hong2007globally}.


\section{Control form and parameter bounds for the model}
From the experiments the system starts only at $u_\omega = 12.93$ which
is the minimum input required to overcome the static friction. This can be
verified as:
\begin{align}
     \lr{V_{in}^2  C_D u_\omega^2 }_{\lr{u_\omega = 12.93, V_{in} = 15.54}} = 1.4570 =  M_f \lr{\frac{V_{in}}{\hat V_{in}}}
\end{align}

Thus, expanding the range of $u_w$ from $[12.93, 67.23]$ to $[0, 67.23]$, the
dynamic model will now include the actual friction instead
of $M_f \lr{1 - \frac{V_{in}}{\hat V_{in}}}$. Rewriting equation~(\ref{eqn::nl_model}):

\begin{align}
    &J \dot \omega + b_m \omega + C_D \omega^2 + M_f = V_{in} \lr{b_m u_\omega + \hat V_{in} C_D u_\omega^2}
    \label{eqn::0_mdl}
\end{align}
