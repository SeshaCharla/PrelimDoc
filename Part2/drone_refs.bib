   abstract = {In this paper, output tracking control of a helicopter model is investigated. The model is derived from Newton-Euler equations by assuming that the helicopter body is rigid. First, we show that for several choices of output variables exact input-output linearization fails to linearize the whole state space and results in having unstable zero dynamics. By neglecting the couplings between moments and forces, we show that the approximated system with dynamic decoupling is full state linearizable by choosing positions and heading as outputs. We prove that bounded tracking is achieved by applying the approximate control. Next, we derive a diffeomorphism showing that an approximation of the system is differentially flat, thus state trajectory and nominal inputs can be generated from a given output trajectory. Simulation results using both output tracking controllers based on exact and approximate input-output linearization are presented for comparison.},

This method emphasizes on the control of roll, pitch and yaw angle rather than the translational motions of the UAV. For this reason the system has been presented into two cascade partial parts, the first one relates the rotational motion whose the control law will be applied in a closed loop form and the other one reflects the translational motion. A dynamic feedback controller is developped to transform the closed loop part of the system into linear, controllable and decoupled subsystem. The wind parameters estimation of the quadrotor is used to avoid more sensors. Hence an estimator of resulting aerodynamic moments via Lyapunov function is developed. Performance and robustness of the proposed controller are tested in simulation.},

An aero-elastic blade design is described and its performance results are presented. A sprung teetering rotor hub that allows adjustment of the blade flapping characteristics and a quad-rotor dynamic model with blade flapping are introduced.

We also show that the model-independent PD controller, where the proportional action is in terms of the vector-quaternion and the derivative action is in terms of the airframe angular velocity, without compensation of the Coriolis and gyroscopic torques, provides asymptotic stability for our problem.

A nonlinear controller ensures the faithful tracking of these trajectories. Experimental results illustrate the application of the method to fast motion (5-10 body lengths/second) in three-dimensional slalom courses. © 2011 IEEE.},

Two main assumptions are formulated: the twisting of the propellers is such that the local angle of attack is constant along the blades in stationary flight, and, secondly, that the local induced velocity is also constant along the blades. Under these assumptions (which correspond to an optimal hovering rotor), we conclude that the flexibility of the propellers plays an important role in the dynamics of the UAV (including the effects of the vertical location of the center of gravity), and that it is interesting to account for it when designing a closed loop controller.},

As a consequence, the hexarotor pose cannot track an arbitrary trajectory while the center of mass is tracking a position trajectory. In this paper, we consider a different hexarotor architecture where propellers are tilted, without the need of any additional hardware. In this way, the hexarotor gains a 6-DoF actuation which allows to independently reach positions and orientations in free space and to be able to exert forces on the environment to resist any wrench for aerial manipulation tasks. After deriving the dynamical model of the proposed hexarotor, we discuss the controllability and the tilt angle optimization to reduce the control effort for the specific task. An exact feedback linearization and decoupling control law is proposed based on the input-output mapping, considering the Jacobian and task acceleration, for non-linear trajectory tracking. The capabilities of our approach are shown by simulation results.},

Both rotation and translation systems are unstable and mathematically nonlinear. These 2 motion systems could be controlled separately. In this paper, we propose an autonomous vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) quadcopter using two controllers; each for one motion system. In rotation, settling time is critical issue, so that input-state feedback linearization is used to regulate/stabilize quadcopter. In translation, tracking error must be near to zero. Fuzzy Takagi Sugeno is used to control quadcopter in translation. Fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno is a genuine way to handle nonlinear system by linear controller using its so-called parallel distributed compensation. The nonlinear model of quadcopter is linearized and controlled at some operating points; Thus, we have some linear models and some linear controllers. Then, fuzzy system is utilized to decide which controller to work. The linear controller used in this paper has H infinity performance to attenuate disturbance. All terms are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI) to find the appropriate gain with ease. The algorithms have been simulated with the help of MATLAB. The results show that the proposed controllers are able to stabilize quadcopter in 0 degrees' position for roll, pitch, and yaw as well as to track the given reference signal. Bounded disturbance can be attenuated thanks to H infinity performance.},

The method, which is proven using a Lyapunov technique, deals seamlessly with both underactuated and fully actuated platforms, and guarantees at least the position tracking in the case of an unfeasible full-pose reference trajectory.

Omniplus multirotor designs are defined as the ones that allow to exert a total wrench in any direction using positive-only lift force and drag moment (i.e., positive rotational speed) for each rotor blade. Algebraic conditions for a design to be omniplus are derived, a simple necessary condition being the fact that at least seven propellers have to be used. An energy optimal design strategy is then defined as the one minimizing the maximum norm of the input set needed to span a certain wrench ellipsoid for the adopted input allocation strategy. Two corresponding major design criteria are then introduced: first, a minimum allocation-matrix condition number aims at an equal sharing of the effort needed to generate wrenches in any direction; second, imposing a balanced design guarantees an equal sharing of the extra effort needed to keep the input in the nonnegative orthant. We propose a numerical algorithm to solve such optimal design problem and a control algorithm to control any omnidirectional platform. The work is concluded with informative simulation results in nonideal conditions.},

The first is the degree of coupling between the total force and total moment generated by the propellers. The second is the ability to robustly fly completely still in place after the loss of one or more propellers, in the case of mono-directional propellers. These are formalized through the definition of some algebraic conditions on the control allocation matrices. The theory is valid for any multirotor, with arbitrary number, position, and orientation of the propellers. As a show case for the general theory, we demonstrate that standard star-shaped hexarotors with collinear propellers are not able to robustly fly completely still at a constant spot using only five of their six propellers. To deeply understand this counterintuitive result, it is enough to apply our theory, which clarifies the role of the tilt angles and locations of the propellers. The theory is also able to explain why, on the contrary, both the tilted star-shaped and the Y-shaped hexarotors can fly with only five out of six propellers. The analysis is validated with both simulations and extensive experimental results showing recovery control after rotor losses.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we propose, discuss, and validate an online Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) method for multi-rotor aerial systems with arbitrarily positioned and oriented rotors which simultaneously addresses the local reference trajectory planning and tracking problems. This work brings into question some common modeling and control design choices that are typically adopted to guarantee robustness and reliability but which may severely limit the attainable performance. Unlike most of state of the art works, the proposed method takes advantages of a unified nonlinear model which aims to describe the whole robot dynamics by explicitly including a realistic physical description of the actuator dynamics and limitations. As a matter of fact, our solution does not resort to common simplifications such as: (1) linear model approximation, (2) cascaded control paradigm used to decouple the translational and the rotational dynamics of the rigid body, (3) use of low-level reactive trackers for the stabilization of the internal loop, and (4) unconstrained optimization resolution or use of fictitious constraints. More in detail, we consider as control inputs the derivatives of the propeller forces and propose a novel method to suitably identify the actuator limitations by leveraging experimental data. Differently from previous approaches, the constraints of the optimization problem are defined only by the real physics of the actuators, avoiding conservative-and often not physical-input/state saturations which are present, e.g., in cascaded approaches. The control algorithm is implemented using a state-of-the-art Real Time Iteration (RTI) scheme with partial sensitivity update method. The performances of the control system are finally validated by means of real-time simulations and in real experiments, with a large spectrum of heterogeneous multi-rotor systems: an under-actuated quadrotor, a fully-actuated hexarotor, a multi-rotor with orientable propellers, and a multi-rotor with an unexpected rotor failure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a predictive controller framework with all the valuable aforementioned features is presented and extensively validated in real-time experiments and simulations.},

   abstract = {Hole drilling and bolt screwing are frequently performed tasks in construction, decoration, and maintenance. Traditionally, sending human workers to perform these tasks in hard-To-reach locations is both dangerous and costly. In this letter, we present an aerial manipulation platform that allows a human user to remotely conduct omnidirectional drilling and screwing. The design of the platform features a quadrotor UAV with each pair of rotors independently tilted by a servo, forming an 'H' configuration, on which a 1-DOF manipulator carrying a motorized drill or screw driver is mounted. With such a design, the end-effector can face any direction on the longitudinal plane and exert a big enough contact force for drilling and screwing without the need of changing the vehicle body's orientation. Compared to previous UAVs that can only drill holes vertically into the ground, the proposed design also allows horizonal drilling/screwing into a wall or a cliff, making it suitable for a vast range of real applications. Based on the dynamic equations of the system, a dual-level control law is proposed. The low-level attitude controller uses an adaptive robust control (ARC) to accurately regulate the attitude angles in the presence of force/torque uncertainties that may occur during the drilling and screwing process, while a selective impedance controller is implemented at high level to indirectly control the contact force commanded by the user. In addition, a vision-based real-Time target identification and tracking method integrating a YOLO v3 real-Time object detector with feature tracking, and morphological operations is developed to identify and track the target point for drilling and screwing specified by the user. Various in-lab experiments on a self-made prototype demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach for aerial drilling and screwing.},

   abstract = {In this article, a novel multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is proposed for enhanced locomotion and manipulation in unstructured environments. The vehicle has a tilting-rotor architecture. Specifically, two pairs of rotors are mounted on two independently controlled tilting arms placed at two sides of the vehicle, forming an 'H' configuration. Such a structure endows the vehicle with more degrees of freedom, improving the maneuverability without sacrificing energy efficiency at the cost of only two additional servos compared to traditional quadcopters. Based on this architecture, a dual-level adaptive robust control is developed to cope with inertial parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities for accurate motion tracking. To resolve the redundancy in actuation, a thrust force optimization problem minimizing power consumption while achieving the desired body force wrench is formulated and solved precisely and efficiently. With the novel design and control, the proposed aerial vehicle is capable of achieving superior maneuverability, better stability and motion accuracy in the presence of uncertainties, as well as improved power efficiency compared to traditional UAVs when performing dexterous aerial locomotion and manipulation. To demonstrate the advantage of the proposed new UAV design and control in real applications, we conduct four challenging experiments on aerial locomotion and manipulation: circular trajectory tracking, passing through a narrow tunnel, picking up an object from a cluttered shelf, and aerial hole drilling. Experimental results validate the applicability of the proposed innovation.},

   abstract = {This letter presents a perception-aware and motor-level non-linear model predictive control scheme for multi-rotor aerial vehicles. Our formulation considers both real actuation limitations of the platform, and realistic perception objectives for the visibility coverage of an environmental feature while performing a reference task. It directly produces the rotor-level (torque) inputs of the platform motors at high frequency, hence it does not require an intermediate unconstrained controller to work. It is also meant to be generic, by covering standard coplanar quadrotors as well as tilted-propeller multi-rotors. We propose an open-source fully onboard implementation of the method, capable of running at 500 Hz under the intermittent and noisy measurements of one or more cameras. The implementation is extensively tested both in simulation and in real experiments with two substantially different multi-rotor platforms, an underactuated and a fully actuated one, both equipped with two cameras, clearly demonstrating the practicability and high performance of the method.},

   abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or drones, are a topic of interest to many academic and industrial research organisations. They find applications in several fields, ranging from military functions to civilian functions. Consequently, the UAVs are expected to perform a wide range of missions, which necessitates a certain level of autonomy. An autonomous UAV relies on an efficient control architecture to perform various tasks and make appropriate decisions. In robotics, control architectures are categorized under six classifications, as we list: deliberative, reactive, hybrid, behaviour, hybrid behaviour, and lastly subsumption architecture. Through this paper, we introduce a short review on a particular type of UAV called Hexacopter or Hexarotor, in which we discuss the items that compose the hexarotor from the very fundamental (framework, sensors...) to the most elaborated parts (modelling, control...). The document covers the flight mechanism, the avionics sensors, the dynamic modelling, and the various control techniques used on a hexacopter. The vision system, the different localisation, and navigation techniques are also explored. At last, but not at least, the focus is directed toward the investigation of the robotics control architectures.},

Although such systems can be used as prototypes, they are not sufficiently robust to serve as experimental robotics platforms. We have developed the X-4 Flyer, a quad-rotor robot using custom-built chassis and avionics with off-the-shelf motors and batteries, to be a highly reliable experimental platform. The vehicle uses tuned plant dynamics with an onboard embedded attitude controller to stabilise flight. A linear SISO controller was designed to regulate flyer attitude.},

@article{lulu1,
   abstract = {Hole drilling and bolt screwing are frequently performed tasks in construction, decoration, and maintenance. Traditionally, sending human workers to perform these tasks in hard-To-reach locations is both dangerous and costly. In this letter, we present an aerial manipulation platform that allows a human user to remotely conduct omnidirectional drilling and screwing. The design of the platform features a quadrotor UAV with each pair of rotors independently tilted by a servo, forming an 'H' configuration, on which a 1-DOF manipulator carrying a motorized drill or screw driver is mounted. With such a design, the end-effector can face any direction on the longitudinal plane and exert a big enough contact force for drilling and screwing without the need of changing the vehicle body's orientation. Compared to previous UAVs that can only drill holes vertically into the ground, the proposed design also allows horizonal drilling/screwing into a wall or a cliff, making it suitable for a vast range of real applications. Based on the dynamic equations of the system, a dual-level control law is proposed. The low-level attitude controller uses an adaptive robust control (ARC) to accurately regulate the attitude angles in the presence of force/torque uncertainties that may occur during the drilling and screwing process, while a selective impedance controller is implemented at high level to indirectly control the contact force commanded by the user. In addition, a vision-based real-Time target identification and tracking method integrating a YOLO v3 real-Time object detector with feature tracking, and morphological operations is developed to identify and track the target point for drilling and screwing specified by the user. Various in-lab experiments on a self-made prototype demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach for aerial drilling and screwing.},
