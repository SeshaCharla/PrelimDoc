\section{Remarks}
The work showcases the effectiveness of using a linearized model dynamics of
an SCR-ASC system for diagnostics. The model, derived from first principles and
grounded on reasonable assumptions, provides a simplified yet insightful
perspective on the SCR system dynamics. This simplification facilitates the
application of system identification methods to obtain unique parameter values.
The model's validity is confirmed using experimental data from test-cell under
specific operating conditions. A particular focus is placed on input gain from
urea dosing to tail-pipe $NO_x$ ($N_{12}$), which is a monotonic function of
catalyst's nominal and total molar storage capacity, proving valuable for
monitoring catalyst aging.
