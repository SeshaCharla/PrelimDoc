\subsection{Reaction Kinetics}
We focus solely on the standard SCR reaction and assume all $NO_x$ in the
exhaust gas to be $NO$, given that commercially available $NO_x$ sensors cannot
differentiate between $NO$ and $NO_2$ (\cite{nova2014urea}). The slow SCR
reaction is not considered, as the exhaust's flow rate ensures that the slow
SCR reaction doesn't significantly contribute to the concentration of tail-pipe
exhaust components. Mass transfer is also neglected, suggesting that the
catalyst's chemical kinetics are reaction controlled, since the standard SCR
reaction rate surpasses the exhaust fluids' flow rate. We assume a $100\%$
nitrogen selectivity for ammonia oxidation both in SCR and in ASC
(\cite{jain2023diagnostics}).


Further, the reaction rates are assumed to be solely dependent on the gas-phase
concentrations of $NO_x$, $NH_3$, the adsorbed Ammonia, and the available
adsorption sites. To facilitate the control volume approach for mass balance,
concentration rates are converted into molar-rate. This is achieved using the
formula: $M_g = C_g V$, leading to $R_i = V r_i$. Rather than considering their
surface concentrations, the number of moles of the adsorbent is taken into
account directly. Additionally, a lower order Taylor approximation is employed
to model the temperature effects in the rate constant.

\begin{align*}
    k_i(\bar T + \delta T) &\approx k_i(\bar T) + p k_i(\bar T) \delta T\qquad
    \text{Where, }\quad   p = \frac{E_a}{R\bar{T}^2},\\
\end{align*}
\begin{align}
    \implies k_i(\delta T) &= \bar k_i + p \bar k_i \delta T
    \label{eqn::rate_approx}
\end{align}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Standard SCR reaction: $4 NH_3 (ads) + 4 NO + O_2 \longrightarrow 4 N_2 + 6 H_2O$
\begin{align*}
    R_1 &= k_1 V C_{NO} M_{NH_3} = k_1V C_{NO} \Theta \theta\\
    k_1 &= A_1 e^{\frac{-E_1}{RT}}
\end{align*}

\item AMOX with/without ASC: $4 NH_3 + 3 O_2 \longrightarrow 2 N_2 + 6 H_2O $
\begin{align*}
    R_3 &= k_3 M_{NH_3} = k_3 \Theta \theta\\
    k_3 &= A_3 e^{\frac{-E_3}{RT}}
\end{align*}

\item Ammonia Adsorption/Desorption: $NH_3 + \theta_{free} \longleftrightarrow NH_3(ads)$
\begin{enumerate}
\item Forward:
\begin{align*}
    R_{4F} &= k_{4F} V C_{NH_3} \lr{\Theta - M_{NH_3}}\\
    k_{4F} &= A_{4F} e^{\frac{-E_{4F}}{RT}}
\end{align*}
\item Reverse:
\begin{align*}
    R_{4R} &= k_{4R} M_{NH_3} = k_{4R} \Theta \theta \\
    k_{4R} &= A_{4R} e^{\frac{-E_{4R}}{RT}}
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
