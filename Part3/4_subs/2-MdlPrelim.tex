\section{Reduced Order Nonlinear Model}

The SCR-ASC system is a complex system with multiple reactions and transport.
The operating conditions and concentrations determine the selectivity of
reactants. The model development involves specific assumptions on these
characteristics which are aligned with the typical operating conditions and
system behavior. The CSTR assumption serves as the foundation for developing
the reaction flow model for SCR reactions. Based on the results of reduced
order modeling from previous studies including
\cite{devarakonda2008adequacy}, \cite{jain2023diagnostics}, we reduce the number
of reactions considered from the full set to three. Initially, we define the
reaction rate constants. Subsequently, we develop a comprehensive parametric
nonlinear model based on state definition of molar storage instead of the
typically used storage fraction state (\cite{nova2014urea}) for consistency with
experimental measurements and slight reduction in the complexity of
expressions.
