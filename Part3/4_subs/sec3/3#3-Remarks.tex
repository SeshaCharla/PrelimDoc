\subsection{Remarks on the linearized model}

Several insights can be drawn from the structure of the $A$ and $B$ matrices in
the linearized model. From the $A$ matrix, it is observed that the change in
$NO_x$ concentration $(\delta x_1)$ influences only the catalyst storage
dynamics of ammonia $(\delta x_3)$, and itself. Urea injection $(\delta x_4)$
similarly only impacts the ammonia concentration dynamics $(\delta x_2)$, and
itself. The dynamics of urea injection are solely affected by its
concentration, independent of other states. A strong coupling is also noted
between ammonia storage and ammonia concentration. Turning to the $B$ matrix,
the $NO_x$ input $(u_1)$ is seen to affect only the $NO_x$ concentration, not
any other state. The dynamics of urea injection $(\delta x_4)$ are found to be
independent of both temperature and $NO_x$ input $(u_1)$, relying only on the
injection rate $(\delta u_2)$ and the flow rate $(\delta f_v)$. Lastly, the
catalyst's ammonia storage is observed to depend exclusively on temperature
change, unaffected by other factors.
