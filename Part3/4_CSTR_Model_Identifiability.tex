\chapter{CSTR Model and Linearized Model Identification}

A prevalent modeling approach is to approximate the PDE (partial differential equation) model from the plug flow reactor
assumption into a set of ODEs (ordinary differential equations) using the idealization of the plug-flow reactor into a
sequence of continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) (\cite{hsieh2011development}, and \cite{nova2014urea}). This
discretization requires at least 2 CSTRs to capture the system dynamics and causality, thereby increasing the model
order. Moreover, the reactions considered are generally confined to selected SCR and ASC reactions. The single CSTR
approach was first justified in \cite{devarakonda2008adequacy} and a nonlinear model was developed using these
assumptions, which was then linearized for feedback control design (\cite{devarakonda2009model}). With this model,
observers were designed to estimate the states corresponding to the catalyst's storage (\cite{ma2017observer},
\cite{jain2020term}). A method for detecting the catalyst's aging by observing the change in the maximum storage
capacity of the catalyst, modeled as an exponential function of temperature, was also proposed in \cite{ma2017observer}.
A common theme in these studies is the non-uniqueness in estimating the nonlinear parameters without a priori
constraints on the actual values. Moreover, these studies assume the availability of all the gaseous states at tail-pipe
to eliminate the effects of cross-sensitivity of the $NO_x$ sensors, which is not always the case in real-world
applications.

The present work aims to address these issues by proposing a reduced order model for the SCR-ASC system, whose parameter
estimation problem would be convex and implicitly considers the $NO_x$ sensor cross-sensitivity. Our approach is based
on the assumption that the detection of aging can be framed as a state/parameter estimation problem concerning the
concentration dynamics of the involved gases. Thus, in this paper, we present the development and validation of such a
reduced order linear model for the SCR-ASC system for diagnostics.
