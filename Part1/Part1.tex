\chapter{Introduction}
The economical and safety related reasons had spurred ever-increasing interest in the theory and applications of model-based fault detection and diagnosis methods. The use of parameter estimation techniques for fault detection of mechanical systems was first demonstrated in \cite{baskiotis1979parameter}, \cite{geiger1982monitoring} \cite{filbert1982quality}, \cite{hohmann1977automatic}. The development of process fault detection methods based on modelling, parameter and state estimation was summarized by \cite{isermann1984process}.
