\subsection{SMI in Adaptive Robust Control Structure}

The parameter bounds estimated using SMI techniques can improve the performance in Adaptive Robust Control designs as
the conservative estimates of the parameter bounds can be further reduced using ellipsoidal sets obtained recursively.
Such an approach of bound shrinking by using SMI techniques along with the usual parameter estimation using gradient
based adaptation low is presented in \cite{lu2009set} and input design for parameter estimation is presented in
\cite{lu2010experimental}. Further, \cite{kosut1992set} presents an adaptive control design using the combination of SMI
techniques and linear robust control design for linear systems. Proposed future work includes directly using centroid of
the ellipsoid for model compensation and the ellipsoidal bounds for projection in Adaptive Robust Control designs
avoiding the additional step of computing the gradient based parameter estimation.
