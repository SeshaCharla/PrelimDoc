\subsection{Fault detection using SMI techniques}

The robustness of SMI to model structure error and noise makes it an ideal candidate for model-based fault diagnosis
using parameter estimates for reduced order models. \cite{combastel2016set} presents recent advances in application of
set membership techniques for fault diagnosis and fault tolerance in diverse systems. From change detection point of
view, the main techniques to detect parameter changes is using consistency tests that check if the intersection of
estimated ellipsoids with the nominal feasible parameter set is non-empty \cite{watkins1996fault},
\cite{ingimundarson2009robust}. This method can be further refined for isolation by including data-hypersector in which
the nominal parameter set lie but not the faulty parameter set \cite{reppa2016fault}.
