\begin{abstract}%
        The present work aims at improving the reliability and performance of two systems, the multirotor actuator and diesel engine SCR-ASC system, using model based fault detection using set membership techniques. A review of fault-detection methods using parameter identification techniques, and change detection methods is presented in the introduction.

        Part 1 discusses the modelling, identification and closed-loop control of the multirotor actuator. The need for RPM feedback in to context of tilted winged multirotors is also discussed. The future work includes fault detection at the actuator level and developing and demonstrating the reconfiguration into static hover control design.

        Part 2 starts with the description of the SCR-ASC system and the need for aging diagnostics. It follows with the linearization and identification of lumped parameters of the system using the conventional reduced order CSTR model used in the literature. Such models effectiveness for capturing the aging signatures under the restrictive conditions is demonstrated. Finally, a discrete nonlinear model based on plug-flow reaction model is developed, parametrized and validated using the test-cell data.

        With the dynamic models for both the systems developed and validated, the future work includes developing fault detection mechanisms using set membership techniques and validating the algorithms using experimental data.
